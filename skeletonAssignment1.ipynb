    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** You are provided with a dataset which contains more than 3000 pictures with either a cat, a dog, a motorbike or a car. The dataset has already been split in training, test and validation sets. Your task is to build and train a CNN which is able to recognize which object is depicted in the picture. To this end, you must use and change the code we presented during our tutorial on classifying cat and dog images. You should copy and unzip the dataset in your local directory (do not change the name of the directory), namely the same directory where this jupyter notebook is going to be stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Python and Keras version.** We recommend you to use Python 3.6 (there might be some incompatibility issues between keras and the most recent versions of Python). We also recommend to use TensorFlow 2.1.0 and Keras 2.3.1, which are the settings we used to test everything. You can find the documentation for keras at the following address https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to submit:** You should post on moodle this jupyter notebook filled will all the answers to the questions, the Python code and the plots. Do not change any part of the code that is provided to you, unless explicitly asked. You should also post on moodle the model for question 5 (name of the model \"modelQ5.h1\"). The answers to the questions should be provided below at the end of the notebook. In case your model has size larger than 100MB please provide a link to Google Drive or other storage services. **Important**: For each question you will get 0 points if the code or any of the plots are missing or the code is not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPU Farm**: You will have access to the HKU GPU farm to do this assignment. Additional info on how to use it is contained in a separate document provided with the assignement. Please use this only for questions 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Size** You should use image size 32x32 for the first three questions. You can use higher resolutions for questions 4 and 5. We kindly ask you to use your machine whenever possible, in order to avoid the GPU farm to be overwhelmed. \n",
